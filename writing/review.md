# Project Development Assessment

## Assessment Overview

Answer all of the following questions in the specified fashion. Please
note that, in addition to ensuring that your GitHub repository has a passing
build, the course instructor will also confirm that you have adequately answered
all of the questions by providing meaningful responses to each of them.

Please note that you are invited to provide responses to all of these questions
as a part of your **Project Development** grade in this course. It is
important to note that if you do not provide satisfactory answers to all of
these questions you will not earn a satisfactory assessment for one or more
parts of the assessment of your work in the project development category.

TODO: You should delete all of the prompts in this file so as to ensure that the
final document is a comprehensive report about your project development.

### Project Development Reflection

#### Explain one project task that you have undertaken and that illustrates the distinction between programming and software engineering

TODO: Please provide a brief one paragraph response to this question.

#### Describe one software engineering task that you could not complete before taking the course but can successfully complete now

TODO: Please provide a brief one paragraph response to this question.

#### Knowing what you do now about project development, what advice would you give to yourself at the start of the academic semester?

TODO: Please provide a brief one paragraph response to this question.

### Project Contributions

TODO: You must provide a response to each of the following prompts by providing
a list of the one or two most recent GitHub references, bearing in mind that
you may provide additional items at your discretion. Please remember that you
should only provide references to the GitHub repositories for `GatorGrade`,
`GatorGrader`, and `ExecExam` that are inside of the `GatorEducator`
organization. This means that you should not provide references to any GitHub
repositories in different organizations that are forks of the main repositories.

##### GitHub Issue Tracker

TODO: Only provide references to the main GitHub repository for one of the
three software tools. This means that you should not reference any issues in
forks of the three software tools or issues in the GitHub repository for the
course web site.

###### Created Issues

TODO: Please provide a list of every GitHub issues that you created

###### Participatory Issues

TODO: Please provide a list of every GitHub issues for which you participated in
the discussion

###### Resolved Issues

TODO: Please provide a list of every GitHub issues for which you helped to
resolve the issue

##### GitHub Pull Requests

TODO: Only provide references to the main GitHub repository for one of the
three software tools. This means that you should not reference any pull
requests in forks of the three software tools or pull requests in the GitHub
repository for the course web site.

###### Reviewed Pull Requests

TODO: Please provide a list of every pull request that you reviewed in the
GitHub repository for a project

###### Created Pull Requests

TODO: Please provide a list of every pull request that you created in
the GitHub repository for a project

###### Discussed Pull Requests

TODO: Please provide a list of every pull requests that you discussed in
the GitHub repository for a project

###### Approved Pull Requests

TODO: Please provide a list of every pull request that was approved for merge to
the main trunk of a project

###### Merged Pull Requests

TODO: Please provide a list of every pull request that was approved for merge to
the main trunk of a project

##### Project Commits

TODO: Please report the number of commits that you made to a pull request that
were ultimately merged to the main/master branch of the project. Importantly,
you should only report the count of commits that were merged into the
main/master trunk branch of the project. This means that you cannot count
commits that were made to a branch for a pull request but not yet merged during
the week range for this specific project development assessment.

###### ExecExam Project

I make `X` commits to main branch of this long-term software project.

###### GatorGrade Project

I make `X` commits to main branch of this long-term software project.

###### GatorGrader Project

I make `X` commits to main branch of this long-term software project.

##### Project Leadership

TODO: Please summarize the ways in which you served as a leader of the project.
Your response to this question should summarize your leadership role in at least
three sentences. If you do not think that you served in a leadership role then
you should summarize what role you played and then further explain why you did
not serve in a leadership role during the development of the projects.

## Project Implementation

### Feature Description

TODO: Using your own words, provide a brief one-to-three sentence description of
a feature that you have added to the tool during this project phase.

TODO: Bearing in mind the previous restriction, your response to this prompt
should, if possible, explain the most "complex" feature that you implemented.

### Command Execution and Output

TODO: Provide output in a fenced code block to illustrate how you would
demonstrate the aforementioned feature of the tool on your laptop. Your
response should also provide the command that you executed in an additional
fenced code block. Please label both code blocks so that their identify is clear.

- Fenced code block for the command that you executed

TODO: Add the command that you executed to produce the following output

- Fenced code block for the output of the command that you executed

TODO: Add the output of the command that you executed in the previous code block.

### Source Code Segment

TODO: Pick one example of a source code segment found in one of the course projects.
Your response to this question should furnish an input to a Python function, the
output of the Python function when provided with the input, and the source code
of the Python function itself. Your response to this question should also walk
through the lines of the source code in detail, demonstrating your understanding
of all the technical software engineering details associated with this source code.
Your response to this question must contain a fenced code block with
the Python source code that you found in the project's GitHub repository.

### Overall Project Assessment

#### Answers to At Least Three Questions

TODO: Please provide an overall assessment of the status of one of the long-term
